Created a basic website to assist my Order of the Arrow Chapter

The Order of the Arrow (OA) is Scouting's National Honor Society. 
I am a member of Nentico Lodge 12 and served as Harford Chapter Chief for the 2026 term.
Throughout middle and high school I have been active in scouting, and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout as a Sophomore.

>I created this website to allow for:
> - Greater communication within the chapter
> - To establish a working email list that members can easily add their email too
> - To gain a better understanding of web development

This video helped a lot for learning the html and css required for the website: {{< extlink url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMT54MPz9oE" text="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMT54MPz9oE" >}} 

The website was coded locally using VS code. It is saved in the cloud through Github and hosted on Netlify.
Google Search Console and Analytics were used for indexing and to get a rough idea of user activity.
